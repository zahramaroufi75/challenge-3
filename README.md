# Getting Started With Unix Domain Sockets

Sockets provide a means of communication between processes, i.e. a way for them to exchange data. The way it usually works is that __process_a__ has __socket_x__ , __process_b__ has __socket_y__ , and the two sockets are connected. Each process can then use its socket to receive data from the other process and/or send data to the other process. One way to think about sockets is that they open up a communication channel where both sides can read and write.
